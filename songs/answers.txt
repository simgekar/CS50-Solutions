Danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, valence, tempo of the top 100 songs of a user can give us a clue about user's
song preferences and his/her vibe.

For example let's say average energy value of the top 100 songs of a user, is bigger than 0.5 and let's assume that
we can categorize a song "energetic" if the average is bigger than 0.5,
In this way for this example we can say that this user likes to listen "energitic" songs.
Let's also assume that orange symbolise the energy. Therefore, we choose this user's aura color is orange.
